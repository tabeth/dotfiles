Is your child labeled as having learning disabilities or dyslexia, and reads nonfluently? 38% of all fourth graders in the United States are struggling at a basic level. They aren't able to enjoy the wonderful world of books. Is your son or daughter one of them?  Does she drone, hesistate and torture words on the page? Does he sound worse than his younger siblings or friends? Does she cry when you give her a book? She isn't alone."><META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="ALL">

<font size=3><b><center>Phonics</center></b></font>
<br>	
Phonics is one method of teaching children how to read.  Children are taught how to "sound 
out" new words by learning the following items:
<ul>
<li>Consonant letters sounds: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z
<li>Blend sounds: br, cr, dr, fr, gr, pr, tr, wr, bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sl, scr, str, sm, sn, sp, sc, sk, 
<li>Short vowel sounds: a, e, i, o, u<br>
    Always teach short vowel sounds first: a - apple, e - elephant, i- igloo, o - octopus, u - umbrella)
<li>Digraph sounds: sh, ch, th, wh<br>
    Two letters combine to make a totally different sound.
<li>Double vowel sounds: ai, ea, ee, oa<br>
    These pairs say the name of the first vowel.
<li>Other double vowel sounds: oi, oo, ou, ow
<li>Silent e: Silent e is bossy, it doesn't say anything but makes the vowel before it
    say its own name.
<li>R controlled vowel sounds: ar, er, ir, or, ur<br>
    Notice that er,ir and ur make the same sound.
</ul>
<p>
Phonics is a series of rules that children have to memorize and apply when they
are sounding out new words. Children are taught a rule, i.e. Silent e, and then they practice
reading words with Silent e.  Then children do skill sheets at their desk highlighting the 
Silent e rule. Children must learn letter sounds to an automatic level - they must be able 
to see the letter(s) and say the sound immediately.
<p>
Critics point out that the reading/practice materials aren't very interesting, "See Spot 
run.  Run Spot run. Spot runs fast."  It is a contrived atmosphere of reading practice using
the phonic rules.  
<p>
Here's the bigger problem: children who struggle in reading memorize phonic rules, and then
are unable to apply phonic rules to connected print. To remedy this problem, two things must
happen:
<ol>
<li>Only the most important phonic rules should be taught in the least complicated manner 
possible. For example, in teaching vowel sounds, it is distracting to talk about "short 
versus long" vowels.  Instead, a child should be taught the short vowel sounds first.  Then
when a child encounters a long vowel as in the word find, tell him, "That vowel says its 
own name." 
<br>
<li>Phonics must be taught in a way that allows these children to immediately practice    
phonic information in real stories.  Every time a child is taught new phonic information, 
he should be given a short reading selection that highlights the phonic rule. Completing a 
skill sheet is good, but even better is to help the child practice applying the phonic skill
to connected print.	
</ol>
<p>
A child cannot learn to read without proper knowledge in phonics. It is the foundation for 
success in reading.  She will succeed to read if she knows phonics.
<br>
<br>

<font size=3><b><center>Whole Language</center></b></font>	
<br>
Whole language is a "whole - part" method of teaching children to read. (Phonics is a "part 
- whole" reading method.) Teachers use connected print to introduce reading to children. 
Children are encouraged to memorize words as whole units.  They do hands-on activities 
such as writing in journals, and analyzing words in context, by using pictures, for meaning.
<p> 
Whole language has strengths in that children begin to write early. They are involved in 
connected print, and they are using personal language skills making the process of reading 
more interesting.  The weakness of whole language methods is that some children never get a 
full phonic foundation.  They are unable to decode unfamiliar words.  Research has shown 
that good readers always use phonics to decipher new words.
<p>
Reading is best taught using a combination of three methodologies:
<ul>
<li>Auditory training - training for the ears to prepare the child's brain for phonics.
<li>Phonics - knowledge of letter(s) sounds.
<li>Whole Language - immediate application of phonics into connected stories.
</ul>
