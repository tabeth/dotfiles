<center><h2>The Reading Wars</h2>
<b>Phonics versus Whole Language</b>
<br><b>&copy; Jon Reyhner, Northern Arizona University, Revised December 
13, 2008</b></center>
<p>There is an educational and political battle going on between proponents
of a phonics emphasis in reading and a whole language emphasis. This battle
is going on in newspaper editorial pages, in state legislatures, and congress.
Proponents of phonics point to a purported decline in reading test 
scores in the 1990s that they
saw as a result of whole language instruction and "scientific" studies 
that
indicated phonics instruction produced better reading scores than other
methods. Whole language advocates point to other reasons to explain those
instances of declining reading scores such as students living in 
poverty and to ethnographic studies of students
in classrooms to support their position. As shown in Figure 1, reading 
scores for students as reported by the U.S. Department of Education's 
National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of 
Educational Progress showed little change from 1992 to 2005.
<p>
<b>Figure 1:</b> National Assessment of Educational Progress 
4<sup>th</sup> Grade Reading Scores 1992-2005
<p>
<img SRC="images/Reading.gif">
<p>As education moved from the home into schools in the eighteenth century,
textbooks were developed to teach reading. The <a 
href="http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/mcguffey.html">McGuffey Readers</a> 
were among
the first of these. They consisted of a graded series of books that are now
called a basal reading series. The first and second grade books were specially
written to include stories that emphasized the sounds of letters in words, 
but the readers for older students were anthologies of stories drawn
from a variety of sources. As well as helping teach reading, the McGuffey
readers emphasized values like the rich helping the poor and being kind
to animals. Teaching in the eighteenth century tended to be teacher-centered
with students doing a lot of rote memorization.
<p>At the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Progressive Education
Movement pushed
for instruction that focused more on the interests of students and what
science was discovering about teaching and learning. More and more stories
were included in basals that emphasized particular sounds or other 
targeted reading skills. These specially written stories with controlled 
vocabularies
were often of little interest to students and did not include ethnic minority
characters. In the 1950s the "Dick and Jane" readers published by Scott
Foresman used a "whole word"
approach to teaching reading where words were repeated on each page enough
times that, according to <a 
href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/behavior.htm">behaviorist</a> 
research, students could remember them.
<p>Phonics proponents led by Rudolph Flesh in his 1955 book <i>Why Johnny Can't
Read</i> attacked the whole word approach because it did not get students
into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled
vocabularies. Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades
and emphasize the importance of students being able to sound out 
(read) words based on how they are spelled. A problem with English is that it
does not have a one-to-one sound symbol relationship that would make reading
much easier. The many homonyms in English such as to, too, and two create
difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling.
<p>While knowing basic phonetic rules helps students sound out words, other
very common "outlaw words" still need to be memorized as sight words because
they don't follow any but the most complicated rules. It is estimated about
half the words in the English language cannot be pronounced correctly using
commonly taught phonic rules. Other problems with phonics 
include the differing
size of students' vocabularies and differing dialects of English that vary
in their pronunciation rules
<p>Phonics is considered a "bottom up" approach where students "decode"
the meaning of a text. The advantage of phonics, especially for
students who come to schools with large vocabularies, is that once
students get the basics down, they can go to the library
and read a wide variety of children's literature.
<p>Whole language is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading
that is based on <a 
href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/constructivism.htm">constructivist 
learning theory</a> and ethnographic studies
of students in classrooms. It is particularly associated with the work
of Ken and Yetta Goodman at the University of Arizona. With whole language,
teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their
students and to combine speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Whole
language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters,
and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language
classroom.
<p>Whole language is considered a "top down" approach where the reader
constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge
to interpret the meaning of what they are reading. Problems associated
with whole language include a lack of structure that has been traditionally
supplied by the scope and sequence, lessons and activities, and extensive
graded literature found in basal readers. Whole language puts a heavy burden
on teachers to develop their own curriculum.
<p><b>Behaviorism versus Constructivism</b>
<p>Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently.
The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning
theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist <a 
href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/skinner.html">B.F.
Skinner</a> while the whole language emphasis draws from constructivist 
learning
theory and the work of the Russian psychologist <a 
href="http://starfsfolk.khi.is/solrunb/vygotsky.htm">Lev Vygotsky</a>.
<p>Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors
where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards
and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished.
Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded
for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition
like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends
when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped
doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist
learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades,
and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully
accomplishing a difficult task.
<p>Constructivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn
by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is
a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize
new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge
in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it (rote learning),
but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning.
<p>Vygotsky identified a "zone of proximal" development where children
can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding
with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge
is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

<p>Students who come from "high literacy" households--where young children
are read to on a regular basis, there are lots of children's
books, and adults read regularly--tend to learn to read well regardless
of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with
large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (an estimated 5% 
can already read when they enter school).
<p>Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading
in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies (as much as one-half 
the vocabularies of students from high literacy homes). They may speak 
non-standard dialects of English such as <a 
href="http://www.cal.org/topics/dialects/aae.html">African 
American English</a> and can be unmotivated students, especially
if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act,
in other words their language and culture. It is argued that standard phonics
approaches can be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches
encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students'
language and culture.
<p>Another issue in teaching reading is the brain development in children. 
Countries like Finland that do very well on international tests, including 
tests of reading, do not 
start to teach reading until students are seven years old when their 
cognitive development is more advanced.
<p>Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry
that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California
and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want
in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are
including systematic phonics instruction, more classic and popular children's
literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes
under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates
of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading
program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests
of their students.
<p>
<b>The Reading Wars, the National Reading Panel and NCLB's Reading 
First</b><sup>2</sup>
<p>The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 through its Reading First 
provisions attempts to improve reading 
instruction in American schools and close the gap in test scores between 
ethnic minorities and mainstream "white" 
Americans. Reading First requires states to show "how the State 
educational agency will assist local educational 
agencies in identifying instructional materials, programs, strategies, and 
approaches, based on scientifically based 
reading research, including early intervention and reading remediation 
materials, programs, and approaches" (NCLB, 
2001, p. 123). The NCLB approach to improving reading instruction is 
grounded in the findings of the congressionally 
mandated report of the <a 
href="http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/default.htm">National 
Reading Panel</a> (NRP) issued in 2000. The 
NRP did not examine research that 
specifically addressed the challenges faced by ethnic minority 
students, English language learners and students speaking non-
standard dialects of English.
<p>The NRP's review of research also ignored the influence of 
motivation on teaching reading. The 2006 report, <i><a 
href="http://www.civicenterprises.net/pdfs/thesilentepidemic3-06.pdf">The 
Silent Epidemic: Perspectives on High School Dropouts,</a></i> 
notes that the lack of student interest and 
engagement is the major reason for dropping out of school (given by almost 
half of high school dropouts). Dropouts 
found their classes to be boring; over two-thirds said they were not 
motivated to work hard in school (Bridgeland, 
DiIulio & Morison). On the other hand studies of effective primary 
teachers found them to be "massively motivating" 
with teachers who are "exceptionally skilled at matching their teaching to 
the needs of individual students" (Allington, 
2002, p. 78).
<p>Peshkin (1997) and Ogbu's (2003) research demonstrates the importance 
of motivation and engagement. In his 
study of a New Mexico Indian high school, Peshkin found that both students 
and their families had ambivalent feelings 
toward schooling. Ogbu noted a similar "academic disengagement" among 
Black students and their families in an 
affluent Ohio suburb. Ethnic minorities, such as Asian Americans, with 
highly positive attitudes toward schooling as a 
group do well in school in contrast to students with ambivalent or 
oppositional feelings because school is viewed as a place for 
cultural assimilation and "acting white" (Fordham & Ogbu, 1986). 
<p>The NRP in its research review excluded all non-experimental studies 
such as correlational and ethnographic 
studies of students actually learning to read in classrooms (Allington, 
2002). Joanne Yatvin (2000), the only member of 
the panel who had actually taught beginning reading in a classroom, in her 
minority report concluded that the NRP 
rushed its review and that "from the beginning, the Panel chose to 
conceptualize and review the field narrowly, in 
accordance with the philosophical orientation and research interest of the 
majority of its members" that biased it 
towards an emphasis on phonics instruction (p. 1). The NRP "did not touch 
on early learning and home support for 
literacy, matters which many experts believe are the critical determinates 
of schools success or failure" (Yatvin, 2000, p. 2).
<p>Despite a phonics predisposition, the NRP concluded that "phonics 
instruction produces the biggest impact on 
growth in reading when it begins in kindergarten or 1st grade before 
children have learned to read independently" and it 
"failed to exert a significant impact on the reading performance of 
low-achieving readers in 2nd through 6th grades" 
(NRP, 2000, pp. 2-93-94). The NRP also noted that "it is important to 
emphasize that systematic phonics instruction 
should be integrated with other reading instruction to create a balanced 
reading program. Phonics instruction is never a 
total reading program.... Phonics should not become the dominant component 
in a reading program, neither in amount 
of time devoted to it nor in the significance attached" (p. 2-97). The NRP 
found that researchers had not paid attention 
to motivational factors for both students and teachers and that there was 
"common agreement that fluency develops 
from reading practice" (p. 3-1). Thus, despite the final reports phonics 
emphasis, the report had embedded in it some 
support for a whole language approach to teaching reading. However, the 
NPR's support for a "balanced approach" in 
its full report was lost in both the official published report summary and 
in the funding by the U.S. Department of 
Education of NCLB Reading First grants to school districts (Garan, 2002).
<p>Educational psychologist Gerald Coles in his point-by-point 
rebuttal to the NPR report notes that the work of 
the NRP has been,
<blockquote>
harmful because it falsely holds out the promise of a simple, "magic 
bullet" solution to the literacy failure of millions of 
children, especially those who are poor, while at the same time 
discouraging social policy attention to forces both in 
and out of schools that influence literacy outcomes. (2000, p. xvii)
</blockquote>
Allington (2002) further notes the glaring lack of scientific evidence to 
show that students who do well with phonics in 
the primary grades transition to become fluent readers in the in the upper 
elementary grades with good reading 
comprehension.
<p>NCLB has provided a billion dollars a year for Reading First programs 
to implement "scientifically-based" reading 
instruction in schools, but Washington Post reporter Michael Grunwald 
noted five years after the passage of NCLB "an 
accumulating mound of evidence from reports, interviews and program 
documents suggest that Reading First has had 
little to do with science or rigor. Instead, the billions have gone to 
what is effectively a pilot project for untested 
programs with friends in high places" (Grunwald, 2006, p. B1). The U.S. 
Department of Education's Office of Inspector 
General found that the application package for Reading First grants 
"obscured the requirements of the [NCLB] statute: 
and that Reading First proposal reviewers were not adequately screened for 
conflicts of interest (U.S. Department of 
Education, 2006, p. 2). After a five-hour investigative hearing on 
conflicts of interest in the funding of Reading First 
grants, Representative George Miller, chairman of the House Education 
Committee, declared that the administration of 
the program "sounds like a criminal enterprise to me" (quoted in Paley, 
2007).
<p>The research-backed Success for All and Reading Recovery programs were 
systematically excluded from Reading 
First funding in favor of programs with less research backing from large 
commercial publishers (Grunwald, 2006). 
However, even Success for All, with all its research backing, has been 
tried and dropped by schools after it did not live up to its promises 
(Pogrow, 2000; Reyhner, 2001a). When the U.S. Department of 
Education's What Works Clearinghouse 
released its 2007 report on beginning reading intervention programs, of 24 
programs with some research backing, only 
Reading Recovery was found to have positive or potentially positive 
effects in all areas reviewed: alphabetics, fluency, 
comprehension, and general reading achievement (What Works Clearinghouse, 
2007) and "none of the most popular 
commercial reading programs on the market had sufficiently rigorous 
studies to be included in the review by the 
clearinghouse" (Manzo, 2007). The Clearinghouse listed 129 programs that 
lacked scientific evidence to support their 
efficacy, including Direct Instruction/DISTAR, Direct Instruction/SRA, 
Hooked on Phonics, and Saxon Phonics. Of the 
six programs that the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian 
Affair's Office of Indian Education Programs 
listed on their Web site as meeting Reading First Grant criteria, only 
Success for All was listed as meeting any of the 
Clearinghouse's criteria.<sup>3</sup>
<p>The 2008 study by the Department of Education's National Center for 
Education Evaluation on Reading First, 
which was generally hailed by phonics advocates, found that even though 
more time was being spent teaching reading 
in Reading First classrooms, "Reading First did not have statistically 
significant impacts on student reading 
comprehension test scores in grades 1-3" (National Center, 2008).
